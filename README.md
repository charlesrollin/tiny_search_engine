## Architecture

Describe global architecture here & pertinent details.

### Global architecture

#### Index Construction

Constructing the inverted index requires 3 steps:
* Parse: build a simple inverted index for each "block" of the collection
* Merge: merge the block indexes and collect statistics on collection
* Refine: use the statistics to refine the index with weights

Below is the class diagram for the Index Construction Module:

![Results](./img/index_construction.png)

The Parse step is multi-threaded(-ish because of [Python GLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock)).
The Merge step outputs various statistics on the collection (e.g. average length of documents, etc.) used to compute advanced weigthing functions.

#### Querying

Two types of queries are supported:

+ Boolean queries of the form: `(foo || bar) && !(foobar)`
+ Vector queries of the form: `foo bar foobar`

![Results](./img/queries.png)

The inverted index file is accessed through the Collection Index Reader. The Reader maintains a map of the position of each term in the index file, which insures a O(1) access to posting lists.

#### Evaluation

The evaluation process runs 64 queries on each of the 9 weight methods selected:

+ the Test Builder manages the whole process by creating an Evaluation Builder for each weight methods.
+ each Evaluation Builder then computes an 11-points interpolated mean curve.
+ eventually, the Test Builder plots the results

### Zoom In

Detail specific technical choices and their reasons.

### Limitations

While this engine works fine with the CACM and CS276 collections, it is not truly scalable for two major reasons:

#### In-memory maps

In order to handle a request, this engine needs two maps:

* `terms = {term: term_id}` maps a term with its id
* `docs = {doc_id: doc_path}` maps a doc id with the document it represents

In addition, a third map improves performances when reading a posting list from the index file.

These maps are a dense index on a set of IDs. If we were to reach the billion terms in a collection, such maps would not fit in memory anymore. One would instead turn them into non-dense indexes pointing at a range of IDs (either stored  in a local file or on another machine).

Such a solution  makes the whole system scalable but has an impact on performances. Hence the use of dense indexes in this engine.

#### IO Buffers

This engine uses simple read/write queues. To represent the memory limitations of the system, these queues have a limited capacty, expressed as an amount of lines.
The default limitation is set to 2200 lines (empirically chosen), which means we assume no more than 2200 posting lists can fit in-memory.

However, posting lists do not have an homogeneous size (long-tail phenomenon) and their size directly depends on the size of the collection! Hence the simplicity of the current queues does not allow a "true" scalability.

To fix this, one would check the size of each posting list before loading it in memory and would express the capacity of the queues as an amount of bytes. This approach will work until posting lists are too big to fit in memory individually.

## Performances

In this section we will discuss:
* Index construction speed & memory performances
* Index size
* Requests speed & IO performances
* Engine evaluation on test set

### Index Construction

The duration of each step of the index construction is displayed below for both test collections:

| Steps | CACM  | CS276 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parse (s)   | 0.5  | 57   |
| Merge (s)   | 0.4  | 60   |
| Refine (s)   | 0.9  | 90   |
| **Total (s)** | 1.8  | 207  |

As we can see, the most expensive step is the refinement of the index: computing weights involves costly mathematical operations whereas parsing and merging involves simple read and copy operations.

### Index size

The index is currently stored as string (hence not the most effective storage method).
```bash
term_id:doc_id, freq, weight|doc_id, freq, weight| ... |doc_id, freq, weight
```
| Items | CACM | CS276 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Collection size (MB) | 13.1 | 430.7 |
| Index size (MB) | 2.2 | 315.5 |
| ID Mappers (MB) | 0.3 | 13.7 |
| Positions (MB) | 0.2 | 6.5 |
| **Total (MB)** | 2.7 | 335.7 |
| **Ratio (%)** | 20.6 | 77.9 |

From the above table, we can see that this storage method is not viable for real-life search engines.

As a solution, one would implement a compression method to decrease the size of the index.

### Requests performance

To improve the time performance of the requests, this search engine heavily relies on a `position` dictionary.
It maps each term ID to a position in the index and allows a O(1)-ish retrieval of a posting list.

Hence at a new request:
* the position of each unique term is retrieved
* the index file is only opened once

### Engine evaluation on requests set

The test set was composed of:
* 64 raw queries (including non-alphanumerical characters and common words)
* the list of relevant documents for each query

A few tests revealed that some queries explicitly referred to authors of articles. As a consequence, the author tag in the CACM collection was included in the scope of this engine.

#### Measures

To choose the best weighting function, two measures were defined:
* Precision / Recall curves for it is very visual
* Mean Average Precision to easily sort the results

#### Weight functions

Nine weight functions were tested:

1. Basic tf-idf
2. Normalized tf-idf
3. Normalized frequency
4. Pivoted document length normalization
5. BM25 (Okapi)
6. Modified BM25
7. Evolutionary learned scheme
8. Divergence from randomness
9. Axiomatic scheme

Except for the first 3, all these functions were taken from http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ronanc/papers/cumminsChapter.pdf

#### Results

This plot sums up the results of the engine evaluation:

One function behaves better than the others: the Evolutionary Learned Scheme (#7).
